## 📋 Project Overview  
This project focuses on analyzing **hotel booking data** from *Elite Hotels International* to uncover insights that can help optimize booking patterns, improve customer satisfaction, and increase overall revenue.  
The goal was to understand **guest behavior, booking trends, cancellations, and pricing strategies** using exploratory data analysis (EDA).

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
Performed data cleaning and preprocessing to prepare the dataset for analysis:  
- Handled **missing values** in columns like `agent`, `company`, and `children`.  
- Converted `reservation_status_date` and `arrival_date` columns to **datetime** format.  
- Checked and removed **duplicate entries** to ensure data accuracy.  
- Standardized **categorical columns** such as `hotel`, `meal`, and `market_segment`.  
- Created new metrics for **total stay duration**, **cancellation rate**, and **booking lead time**.

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Performed  

### 🔹 Basic-Level Analysis  
- Calculated **average lead time** and **stay duration** for bookings.  
- Visualized **bookings by hotel type** (City Hotel vs Resort Hotel).  
- Analyzed **cancellation rate** and identified total canceled bookings.  
- Found the **most common arrival month** and **peak booking periods**.  
- Calculated **average number of special requests per booking**.  
- Identified **countries with highest number of bookings**.  
- Computed **average ADR (Average Daily Rate)** for each hotel type.  
- Calculated **percentage of guests requiring car parking spaces**.  
- Compared **average stay duration** across weekdays and weekends.  
- Determined **bookings made via travel agents** and their contribution.

### 🔹 Medium-Level Analysis  
- Compared **cancellation rates between Resort and City Hotels**.  
- Calculated **average ADR per market segment**.  
- Explored **relationship between lead time and cancellation rate**.  
- Identified **most popular booking distribution channels**.  
- Analyzed **average previous cancellations by hotel type**.  
- Visualized **ADR trend over different years**.  
- Found **highest revenue-generating months**.  
- Explored **impact of special requests on ADR**.  
- Compared **stay duration between repeated and new guests**.  
- Identified **most booked room types**.  

---

### 🔹 Advanced-Level Analysis  
- Identified **key factors influencing cancellation rate** using correlation and regression.  
- Analyzed **how ADR varies with number of adults, children, and babies**.  
- Studied the relationship between **booking changes and guest satisfaction**.  
- Explored **seasonal trends** in booking and cancellation patterns.  
- Compared **lead time distribution across different market segments**.  

---

## 📈 Insights & Key Findings  
- **City Hotels** received more bookings, but **Resort Hotels** generated higher ADRs.  
- **Longer lead times** are correlated with **higher cancellation rates**.  
- Most bookings occurred during **summer months (July–August)**, indicating seasonal demand.  
- Guests from **Portugal, the UK, and France** were among the top sources of bookings.  
- **Transient customers** were the dominant customer type.  
- Guests with **more special requests** generally had **higher ADR values** and satisfaction.  
- **Repeated guests** stayed longer and had fewer cancellations.  
- **Direct bookings and online travel agents** were the most popular distribution channels.  
- **ADR increased steadily from 2015 to 2017**, indicating improved pricing performance.
